Blockchain-Enabled Distributed Rummy: Proof for the Designers in Online Skill Gaming Industries

Authors: Debendranath Das and Subhamoy Maitra

We have presented a smart contract written in Solidity for a rummy game designed for two players, supported by transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. Please note that this portion only focuses on the blockchain aspect; offline computations are not included. Additionally, the complete game design, including the graphical user interface (GUI), is still in place. This can be considered a toy application that demonstrates the use of blockchain technology in an online rummy game.
